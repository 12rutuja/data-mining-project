# data-mining-project
project name is economic clusture analysis of indian states 
we implemented a qualitative methodology to determine the values of the k-means algorithms from the four clusters obtained. The research work also provided the pro, cons, the algorithm steps and flow chart for the K-Means clustering process. The results of state were analyzed by utilizing the K-means node of the workflow model connection in KNIME tool. The K-means clustering algorithm can serve a better benchmark to observe the performance of state with Fiscal Deficit.
 Cluster 0 means those states having High value of Fiscal Deficit and High value of expenditure. These states need to work on their Fiscal deficit, which means reduce overall expenditures and increase the total revenue of the
states. So, these states need not to urge for loan from central government for further expenditures
